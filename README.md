# Energy_Weather_first_attempt
This code is my first attempt at looking into the energy kaggle competition

There is some exploratory data analysis and then some initial forecasts using the sktime and darts 
timeseries libraries to forecast energy usage. Currently only some basic univariate anlysis is done
the idea is to now use some multivariate techniques to get better results.
